Laravel Developers:-
This is the source of [jasonlewis.me](http://jasonlewis.me) and it's built entirely on [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com).

### Having A Look

You can have a look at the site locally by cloning this repository and running `composer install`. You can then use the in-built server of PHP 5.4 by running `php artisan serve` and then visiting `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Requirements

To run you'll need PHP 5.4 and Redis. If you don't have Redis you can switch the caching and session drivers.
